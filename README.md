## About

Technically a random event driven text-based game.

You can [play it here](https://research.wmz.ninja/projects/phd/index.html) (using modern browsers or mobile devices).

Random events are defined in [YAML files](static/rulsets/default). Therefore, the game is easily moddable,

Currently the GUI code is purely vanilla, and kind of messy. I may clean it up if I have time.
